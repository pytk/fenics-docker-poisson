# fenics-docker-poisson

 This repository's goal is computing partical differencies equation especially poisson equation. It can work in Docker for Mac like below:

 ```bash
 # mount a volume in local machine to share some file with a docker container
 $ docker run -it -v $(pwd):/home/fenics/shared [fenicspath] --name [name]

 # satart container
 $ docker satart

 # execute container with command line
 $ docker exec -it [name] /bin/bash -l
 ```

### Boundary function for Dirichlet condition

Using FEniCS which is a science compuing library to calculate with fenite element method for solving partial difference equation. The goal is solving self-consistent problem about poisson equation and schrodinger equation in an inversion layer of Germanium channel ultran thin mosfet.

we have to consider boudary conditon based on semiconductor physics not only considering electron distribution.

And we assume the device structure is like below

this project is still going on. Eventually, I'm going to apply to electron transport problem with Monte Carlo Simlation.


## Schrodinger Equation 

calculate schrodinger equation in 1d slice of 2d electro static potential array. you can get 2d electro static potential from 2d Poisson Equation.
