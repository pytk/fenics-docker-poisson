function initializeParticle(electron_density, device, Gm, eigen_values, constant)
    #=
    Return particle information like wave number (kx, ky)
    position, subband number, etc ... for each particle.
    as an args, we can get potential and eigen value from schrodinger-poisson loop process, so we have to assign each particle to specific subband firstly
    when it comes to kenetic energy, we assign random value to each particle

    Args:
        - electron_density[x, z] electron density distribution from self-consistent schrodinger-poisson loop

        - eigen_values [subband, nx] eigen value from schrodinger equation for each slice along x-axsis

        - p[particle number][i]
            - i = 1: subband 1 ~ 3 but 8 means 3d particle and 9 means the particle in ohmic or schottky layer so it would be deleted
            - i = 2: kx
            - i = 3: ky
            - i = 4: ts (free flight time)
            - i = 5: x (x position)
            - i = 6: z (z position)
        - scattering_rate

    Note: we are only taking consider 2d particle gas not 3d particle,
          hence, we don't need to consider kz because the energy along the z-axis is discretized
